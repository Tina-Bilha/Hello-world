Here is a breakdown of what i did in my project
Create a folder somewhere on your PC and open terminal or cmd or whatever and set the directory to that folder

my folder is called mysite
C:\Users\Ijas\Desktop> mkdir mySite

Now we need to initialize our project

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.
See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.
Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.
Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (mysite)
